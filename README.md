# panorama
This project is capable of stitching together a panorama from multiple input images.
The code is **not** optimized at this point, and revisions are forthcoming to boost efficiency

To run the code, call `python3 gui.py` from the command line to activate the GUI, then select the appropriate tab for whichever task you would like to try. Make sure that all images being stitched are of the same dimensions, it's a delicate pano stitcher.
